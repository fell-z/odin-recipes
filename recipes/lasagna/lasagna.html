            <li>2 teaspoons dried basil (Optional)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet
                until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Add spaghetti
                sauce, tomatoes, onion, garlic, basil, oregano, salt and pepper. Cook over low heat
                until sauce is hot, about 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Meanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil.
                Cook mafalda noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes.
                Drain.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Add cooked and drained noodles to the sauce and stir until completely coated.
                Sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Place skillet under the hot broil and cook until cheese is golden and bubbly, 3 to 5
                minutes.
            </li>
        </ol>
